# 🤠 Howdy!

## A little bit about me

#### 🔨 I build things

I build full-stack web and mobile apps using primarily JavaScript and Python tooling. React and Svelte for frontend web, React Native for mobile, and Node.js on the backend, and Python for automation.

#### 🏹 I lead teams

Building large-scale software is a team sport, and I love leading by example. I'm a strong communicator who fully embraces the non-technical side of software development.

#### 🖌 I design things

Though I'm not trained as a designer, I enjoy thinking about design and user experience. I'm particularly fascinated with graphics/modeling and animation.
